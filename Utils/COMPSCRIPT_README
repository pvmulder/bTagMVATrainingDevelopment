====================================
Description of the CompScript method
====================================

1. A compilation of the plot macro is done. Two macros are written doing almost the same:
	a) MVAVarPlotter produces global distributions
	b) MVAVarPlotter_etabin enables to plot in eta bins (0-1.4 and 1.4-2.4 are defined). Two comparison variants are possible, decided by argument given in the main function at the end of the macro:
		i) compare jet-flavors in a given eta-bin
		ii) compare eta-bins for a given jet-flavor
	Numerous comments are present in the macro to explain the various steps
2. The resulting binary is executed
3. This execution leads to locking of the teminal until you close with ctrl+c. This closes all canvas opened by the execution of the binary
