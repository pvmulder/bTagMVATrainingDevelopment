How to use shape plotters found in UserCode/PetraVanMulders/BTagging/Utils to plot the shape of MVA input variables

	1. Execute the Collector.sh script see COLLECTOR_README
	2. Execute the CompScript.sh script see COMPSCRIPT_README
	
Collector.sh collects variables from the jets found in the different trees (different pt-bins), produced with the extractor.py from the CSVLR_default/ directory, and stores the variables in Histos.root

CompScript compiles the macro to plot the variables collected in Histos.root in histograms which are stored in .pdf, .png and .root in plots directory

More details on the content of these two .sh scripts in the corresponding README files
