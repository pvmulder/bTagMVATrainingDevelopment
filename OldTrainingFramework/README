tested in CMSSW_4_4_4 with globaltag START_44_V5::All

* checkout RecoBTau/JetTagMVALearning
* change the BuildFile in RecoBTau/JetTagMVALearning/plugins with the BuildFile in this directory
* cmsRun extractor.py on some RECO QCD sample to produce the trees 
(AOD works too, but then the process.btagging should be switched on to remake the tagInfos)
* ./doall.sh
* cmsRun copyMVAToSQLite_cfg.py to make a .db file
* cmsRun reco_validationNEW_CSVMVA_categories_cfg.py (make the btag DQM file)
---> make sure global tag is consistent
---> in case of AOD input you might need to remake the tagInfos
---> read in the .db file that you made to validate the training
* root -l CompareTaggers.C for the comparison of the different taggers in the DQM file
